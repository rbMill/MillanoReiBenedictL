Vector - a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: magnitude and direction. Some examples of a vector are displacement, velocity, acceleration
	Ex.
		A car moved with a vector 60 kilometers per hour on to the southlane.

Scalar - a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude. Examples of scalars are volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time.
	Ex.
		A cube with a 3 meters of side length has an area of 9 meters squared on each face with a volume 27 meters cubed which are all scalar quantities.

Gravity - The force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth, or toward any other physical body having mass.
	Ex.	The moisture in the clouds turns to rain as it is dictated down by gravity as to how rivers and waterfalls flow from their highest to the depths.
